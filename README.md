# SocialMediaApp

This is a social media app that will be made after the completion of this course on Udemy: https://www.udemy.com/course/react-native-mobile-app-development/ 

I decided to continue the project and make the backend as well, since only the frontend was made.


## Demo


## Technologies used

- React Native (v0.72.6)
- Firebase
- Javascript
- React-native-fontawesome(0.3.0)
- React-native-svg


## Run Locally

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/FukurouHaiRiyo/SocialMediaApp

```

Start the server
